BFCache, or Back-Forward Cache, is a browser feature that caches the state of a webpage when a user navigates away from it, typically by using the back or forward buttons. When the user returns to the page, the browser can quickly reload the cached page instead of re-requesting it from the server. This helps improve the user experience by making navigation faster and more seamless.
