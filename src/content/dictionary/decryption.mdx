Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back into its original, unencrypted form. It is the reverse process of encryption and is typically performed using a decryption key or algorithm.

When data is encrypted, it is transformed into a format that is not easily readable or understandable. Decryption reverses this process, restoring the data to its original form so that it can be understood and used by the intended recipient.

**Example:**
Consider a simple example of symmetric encryption and decryption using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm:
- **Encryption:** The original data is encrypted using a secret key to produce encrypted data.
- **Decryption:** The encrypted data is decrypted using the same secret key to recover the original data.

```plaintext
Original Data: Hello, World!
Encryption Key: 1234567890ABCDEF
Encrypted Data: 2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C
