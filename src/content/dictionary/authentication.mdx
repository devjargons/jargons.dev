Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system, typically before granting access to resources or services. Authentication ensures that the entity requesting access is who or what it claims to be. This process is crucial for maintaining security and privacy in computer systems and networks.

Authentication is often performed using a combination of factors, such as something the user knows (e.g., a password), something the user has (e.g., a security token), or something the user is (e.g., biometric data). By requiring multiple factors for authentication (multi-factor authentication), the security of the authentication process is increased.

**Examples:**
- **Username and Password:** A common form of authentication where users provide a username and password to access an account.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Requires users to provide two forms of verification, such as a password and a code sent to their phone, to access an account.
- **Biometric Authentication:** Uses unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to verify a user's identity.

Authentication is an essential component of cybersecurity, ensuring that only authorized users or systems have access to sensitive information or resources. It helps protect against unauthorized access and maintains the integrity of systems and data.
