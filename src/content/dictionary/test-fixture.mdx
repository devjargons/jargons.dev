title: "Test Fixture"

A test fixture is a fixed state of a set of objects used as a baseline for running tests in software development. It ensures that tests are reliable and consistent by providing a known environment in which the tests are executed.

In the context of software testing, a test fixture is used to set up the necessary environment or conditions before executing a test. It involves initializing objects, configuring settings, or preparing any necessary data. This setup helps ensure that tests are repeatable and produce consistent results by isolating the tests from external influences or state changes.

For example, if you are testing a function that interacts with a database, the test fixture might include creating a temporary database, populating it with test data, and then cleaning up after the test is executed. This way, the test runs in a controlled environment, making it easier to identify issues and verify the correctness of the code.

**Code Example** (JavaScript using Jest):
```javascript
// Sample test fixture using Jest

const { initializeDatabase, clearDatabase } = require('./databaseHelper');
const { fetchData } = require('./dataService');

beforeEach(() => {
  // Setup the test fixture
  initializeDatabase();
});

afterEach(() => {
  // Cleanup the test fixture
  clearDatabase();
});

test('fetchData returns the correct data', () => {
  const data = fetchData();
  expect(data).toEqual(expectedData);
});
```

In this example, `initializeDatabase` sets up the necessary environment before each test, and `clearDatabase` cleans up after each test to ensure isolation and consistency.
