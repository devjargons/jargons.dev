Singleton is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

- **Instance Control:** The Singleton pattern is used when you want to ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a way to access that instance from any part of the application.

- **Global Access:** By providing a global point of access to the instance, the Singleton pattern allows you to access the same instance from multiple parts of the codebase without the need to pass references around.

**Example:**
```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

**Usage:**
```java
Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();
```
