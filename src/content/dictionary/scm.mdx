Source Control Management (SCM), also known as Version Control System (VCS), is a system used to manage changes to source code and other files. SCM tracks modifications to files over time, allowing developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and revert to previous versions if necessary.

SCM systems maintain a history of changes to files, along with information about who made the changes and when. This history is stored in a repository, which can be centralized (e.g., SVN) or distributed (e.g., Git). Developers can use SCM to check out a copy of the code, make changes, and then commit those changes back to the repository.

**Example (Git Command):**
An example of using Git, a popular SCM tool, to commit changes to a file:
```sh
$ git add myfile.txt    # Stage the changes
$ git commit -m "Added new feature"    # Commit the changes
$ git push origin master    # Push changes to the remote repository
```
