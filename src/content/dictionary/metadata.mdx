Metadata is data that provides information about other data. It describes various attributes of data, such as its format, structure, quality, and context. Metadata is commonly used in information systems to organize, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.

Metadata can include information about the creation date of data, the author or creator, the location where the data was created, and keywords or tags that describe the content of the data. It can also include technical details such as file format, data size, and data type.

**Example (HTML Metadata):**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Page</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="description" content="This is an example page.">
    <meta name="keywords" content="example, metadata, HTML">
    <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the HTML document contains metadata in the `<head>` section. The `<meta>` tags provide information such as the character set (`charset`), description, keywords, and author of the page.
