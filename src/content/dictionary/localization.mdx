Localization is the process of adapting a product or content to meet the language, cultural, and other requirements of a specific target market or locale. It involves translating the text, modifying the design and functionality, and adapting the content to suit the preferences of the target audience.

Localization goes beyond mere translation and considers cultural nuances, local customs, and legal requirements. It aims to make the product or content feel as natural and familiar to the target audience as possible, enhancing user experience and acceptance.

**Key Aspects of Localization:**
1. **Language Translation:** Adapting text to the language of the target audience.
2. **Cultural Adaptation:** Modifying content to reflect cultural norms, customs, and preferences.
3. **Design and Layout:** Adjusting the design and layout to accommodate text expansion or contraction.
4. **Functionality:** Modifying functionality to comply with local regulations or preferences (e.g., date formats, units of measurement).
5. **Legal Requirements:** Ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations related to content, privacy, and accessibility.

**Example:**
A software application originally developed in English is localized for the Japanese market by translating all text into Japanese, modifying the date and time formats to match local conventions, and incorporating Japanese cultural references into the design and content.
