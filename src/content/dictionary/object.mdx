In programming, an object is a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. Objects are instances of classes, which define the structure and behavior of the objects. Objects are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP).

Objects are used to model real-world entities or concepts in a program. They encapsulate data and behavior into a single unit, allowing for modular and reusable code. Objects can interact with each other through methods and can be used to represent complex systems in a clear and organized manner.

**Example (Python):**
```python
# Example of a simple class and object in Python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

# Creating an object of the Person class
person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
person1.greet()
```
