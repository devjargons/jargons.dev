Encryption is the process of converting plain text or data into a secret code to prevent unauthorized access. It is used to protect sensitive information, such as passwords, financial data, and personal messages, from being read by unauthorized users.

Encryption works by using an algorithm and an encryption key to scramble the original data into an unreadable format, known as ciphertext. Only users with the correct decryption key can reverse the process and convert the ciphertext back into its original form.

**Key Concepts of Encryption:**
1. **Encryption Algorithms:** Encryption algorithms determine how the plaintext is transformed into ciphertext. Common encryption algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA, and DES (Data Encryption Standard).
2. **Encryption Keys:** Encryption keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data. The strength of encryption depends on the complexity and length of the encryption key.
3. **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption:** In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. In asymmetric encryption, different keys are used for encryption and decryption.
4. **Data Integrity:** Encryption helps ensure the integrity of data by protecting it from unauthorized modification during transmission or storage.
5. **Security:** Encryption is a crucial tool for data security, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and data breaches.

**Example:**
Consider a simple example of symmetric encryption using the Caesar cipher:
- **Plaintext:** "HELLO"
- **Encryption Key:** Shift each letter by 3 positions (e.g., A -> D, B -> E, etc.)
- **Ciphertext:** "KHOOR"
