In the context of web design and layout, gutters refer to the space between columns or elements in a grid layout. Gutters help to visually separate columns and create a more organized and structured layout.

Gutters are used in grid systems to provide spacing between columns, which improves readability and helps to establish a visual hierarchy. They can be adjusted to create different effects, such as increasing or decreasing the space between columns based on the design requirements.

```css
.column {
    float: left;
    width: 50%;
    padding: 0 10px; /* Add 10px padding on the left and right to create gutters */
    box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding in the element's total width */
}
```
