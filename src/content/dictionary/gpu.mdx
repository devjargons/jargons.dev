title: "GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)"
---
A GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.

GPUs are designed to perform calculations required for rendering graphics and images quickly and efficiently. They excel at parallel processing tasks, making them well-suited for handling large amounts of data simultaneously. In addition to graphics rendering, GPUs are increasingly used for general-purpose computing tasks that can benefit from parallel processing, such as scientific simulations, machine learning, and cryptocurrency mining.
