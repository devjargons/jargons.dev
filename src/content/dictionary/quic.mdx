QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is a transport layer network protocol developed by Google. It is designed to provide fast, reliable, and secure internet connections, improving upon traditional protocols like TCP.

QUIC combines features of both TCP and UDP, aiming to reduce latency and improve the performance of internet applications. Unlike TCP, which establishes a connection with a three-way handshake, QUIC uses a single handshake to establish a secure connection. This reduces the time it takes to start data transmission.

QUIC is built on top of UDP, allowing it to avoid some of the overhead associated with TCP. It includes built-in encryption based on TLS (Transport Layer Security), ensuring data security without the need for separate HTTPS layers.

**Example (QUIC Connection Establishment):**

In QUIC, a connection is established with a single round-trip handshake:

1. **Client sends Initial packet:** The client sends a packet to the server to initiate the connection.
2. **Server responds with Handshake packet:** The server responds with the necessary information to establish a secure connection.
3. **Client confirms:** The client confirms the connection and starts sending data.
