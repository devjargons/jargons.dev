Progressive enhancement is a web design and development approach that focuses on delivering a basic, usable version of a website or web application to all users, regardless of their device or browser capabilities. It then progressively enhances the user experience for users with more capable devices or browsers by adding advanced features and enhancements.

The core idea behind progressive enhancement is to start with a solid foundation that works for everyone and then add enhancements that take advantage of more advanced features supported by modern browsers. This approach ensures that all users can access and use the website or web application, even if they have older devices or browsers that do not support the latest technologies.
