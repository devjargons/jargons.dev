A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website). When a client sends a request to access a resource, the proxy server forwards the request to the server on behalf of the client. The server then sends the response back to the proxy server, which forwards it to the client.

Proxy servers can be used for various purposes, including improving performance, enhancing security, and providing anonymity. They can cache resources to reduce the load on the server and improve response times for clients. They can also filter requests to block malicious content or unauthorized access. Additionally, proxy servers can hide the IP address of the client, providing a level of anonymity for users.

**Example:**
- **Caching Proxy:** A caching proxy server stores copies of frequently accessed resources, such as web pages or images, locally. When a client requests one of these resources, the proxy server can serve it directly from its cache, reducing the time and bandwidth required to access the resource.
