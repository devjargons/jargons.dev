SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized language used to interact with relational databases. It is used for querying, updating, and managing data in databases.

SQL provides a set of commands that allow users to perform various tasks related to database management. Some common SQL commands include SELECT (to retrieve data), INSERT (to add new records), UPDATE (to modify existing records), and DELETE (to remove records).

SQL is a declarative language, meaning that users specify what data they want to retrieve or manipulate, rather than how to retrieve it. This makes SQL easy to use and understand, even for users who are not familiar with programming.

**Example (SQL Query):**
A simple SQL query to retrieve all records from a table named "customers":
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;
```
