**WebAssembly** (sometimes abbreviated as WASM) defines a portable binary-code format and a corresponding text format for executable programs. It also provides software interfaces for interactions between such programs and their host environment. Here are the key points about WebAssembly:

1. **Performance**: WebAssembly runs with near-native performance, making it suitable for high-performance applications on web pages. It doesn't assume any web-specific features, so it can be used in other environments too.

2. **Language Support**: WebAssembly aims to support any language on any operating system. Popular languages like C/C++, Rust, and C# already have some level of WebAssembly support.

3. **History**: Announced in 2015, WebAssembly became a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation in 2019. It received the Programming Languages Software Award from ACM SIGPLAN in 2021. Major browser vendors, including Mozilla, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Fastly, Intel, and Red Hat, contribute to its development.
