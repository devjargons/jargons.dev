---
WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling code written in languages such as C, C++, and Rust to be run on web browsers.

- **Portable Compilation Target:** WebAssembly is designed to be a compilation target for high-level programming languages, allowing them to be compiled into a binary format that can be executed in a web browser.
  
- **Efficient and Fast:** WebAssembly is designed to be efficient and fast, with performance close to that of native code. This makes it suitable for performance-critical applications such as games and multimedia applications.

**Example:**
A simple example of using WebAssembly with JavaScript:

```javascript
// Load and instantiate a WebAssembly module
fetch('example.wasm')
  .then(response => response.arrayBuffer())
  .then(buffer => WebAssembly.instantiate(buffer))
  .then(result => {
    // Call a function from the WebAssembly module
    result.instance.exports.myFunction();
  });
```
