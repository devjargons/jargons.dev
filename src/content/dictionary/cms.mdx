A Content Management System (CMS) is a software application or set of related programs that are used to create and manage digital content. CMSs are typically used for websites and blogs to allow users to easily create, edit, and publish content without requiring technical knowledge of web development.

CMSs provide a user-friendly interface that allows non-technical users to manage content on their websites. They often include features such as content editing, workflow management, version control, and publishing. CMSs are designed to simplify the process of managing digital content and enable collaboration among multiple users.

**Example:**
WordPress is one of the most popular CMSs and is used by millions of websites worldwide. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing content, themes for customizing the look and feel of a website, and plugins for extending functionality.
