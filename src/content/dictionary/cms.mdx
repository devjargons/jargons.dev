A Content Management System (CMS) is a software application or set of related programs that are used to create and manage digital content. CMSs are typically used for websites and blogs to allow users to easily create, edit, and publish content without requiring technical knowledge of web development.

CMSs provide a user-friendly interface that allows non-technical users to manage content on their websites. They often include features such as content editing, workflow management, version control, and publishing. CMSs are designed to simplify the process of managing digital content and enable collaboration among multiple users.

**Key Components of a CMS:**
1. **Content Creation:** Allows users to create and edit content using a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor.
2. **Content Storage:** Stores content in a database, allowing for easy retrieval and management.
3. **Workflow Management:** Allows for the creation of workflows for content creation, editing, and approval.
4. **Version Control:** Tracks and manages different versions of content, allowing for easy rollback to previous versions.
5. **Publishing:** Allows users to publish content to a website or other digital platform.
6. **User Management:** Provides tools for managing user roles and permissions, allowing for secure access to content.

**Example:**
WordPress is one of the most popular CMSs and is used by millions of websites worldwide. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing content, themes for customizing the look and feel of a website, and plugins for extending functionality.
