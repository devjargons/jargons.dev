Big Data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that traditional data processing software cannot handle efficiently. These datasets are characterized by their volume, velocity, and variety, often requiring advanced analytics and storage solutions to extract meaningful insights.

Big Data encompasses datasets that are too large or complex for traditional database systems and data processing tools. It involves the collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of vast amounts of data from various sources, often in real time. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behavior and interactions.

**Characteristics of Big Data:**
1. **Volume:** The sheer amount of data generated every second from various sources such as social media, sensors, transactions, and more.
2. **Velocity:** The speed at which new data is generated and processed to meet the demands.
3. **Variety:** The different types of data, including structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.
4. **Veracity:** The quality and accuracy of the data, which can vary greatly.
5. **Value:** The potential insights and benefits derived from analyzing the data.
