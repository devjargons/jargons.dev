A variable is a named storage location in a computer's memory that holds a value that can be modified during program execution.

Variables act as containers for storing data values. Each variable has a name (identifier) and a data type, which determines the kind of values it can hold (such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc.). Variables provide a way to label and work with data in a readable and organized manner.

**Example:**
Here is an example of using variables in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Variable declaration and initialization
let name = 'Alice'; // 'name' is a variable of type string
const age = 30; // 'age' is a constant variable of type number

// Reassigning a new value to the variable
name = 'Bob';

// Printing the values to the console
console.log(name); // Output: Bob
console.log(age); // Output: 30

// Using a variable in a function
function greet() {
    let greeting = 'Hello, ' + name + '!';
    console.log(greeting);
}

greet(); // Output: Hello, Bob!
```

**Explanation of the Example:**
- **Declaration and Initialization:** `let name = 'Alice';` declares a variable `name` of type string and initializes it with the value `'Alice'`. `const age = 30;` declares a constant variable `age` of type number and initializes it with the value `30`.
- **Reassignment:** The value of the variable `name` is changed to `'Bob'`.
- **Function Scope:** A local variable `greeting` is declared within the `greet` function, which combines the string `'Hello, '` with the value of the variable `name`.
- **Console Output:** The `console.log` statements print the values of `name` and `age`, and the `greet` function prints the greeting message.

Variables are a core concept in programming, enabling developers to manage and work with data efficiently and effectively.
