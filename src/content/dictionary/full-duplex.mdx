Full Duplex refers to a communication system that allows simultaneous two-way communication, where both parties can send and receive data at the same time. This is in contrast to half-duplex systems, where communication can only occur in one direction at a time.

In a full-duplex communication system, each party has a dedicated channel for sending and receiving data, allowing for independent and simultaneous communication in both directions. This is commonly seen in telecommunications, networking, and data transmission systems, where real-time, bidirectional communication is required.

**Example:**
An example of a full-duplex communication system is a telephone conversation. Both parties can speak and listen at the same time, enabling a natural and uninterrupted flow of communication. This is made possible by the use of dedicated channels for sending and receiving audio signals.
