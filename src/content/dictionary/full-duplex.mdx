Full-duplex data transmission means that data can be transmitted in both directions on a signal carrier at the same time. 

For example, on a local area network with a technology that has full-duplex transmission, one workstation can be sending data on the line while another workstation is receiving data. 

Full-duplex transmission implies a bidirectional line that can move data in both directions simultaneously.
