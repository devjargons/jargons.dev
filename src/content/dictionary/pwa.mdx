Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that use modern web technologies to provide a user experience similar to that of mobile apps. PWAs are designed to be fast, reliable, and engaging, and they work across all devices and platforms, including desktop and mobile.

PWAs leverage features like service workers, web app manifests, and responsive design to offer a native app-like experience. They can be installed on a user's device and accessed from the home screen, without the need for an app store. PWAs are designed to work offline or in low network conditions, making them suitable for a wide range of use cases.
