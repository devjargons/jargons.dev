title: "Fuzz Testing"
---
Fuzz testing, or fuzzing, is a software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as input to a computer program. The goal of fuzz testing is to discover vulnerabilities, bugs, or crashes in the program by observing its behavior when it receives such inputs.

Fuzz testing is particularly useful for finding security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and input validation issues, which can be exploited by attackers. By subjecting a program to a large volume of random or carefully crafted inputs, fuzz testing can help uncover these vulnerabilities before they are exploited in the wild.
