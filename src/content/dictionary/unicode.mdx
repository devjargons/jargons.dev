---
Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. It aims to be a universal character encoding standard, enabling the interchange, processing, and display of text in any language, script, or symbol system.

Unicode assigns each character a unique code point, which is a numerical value that represents the character. This allows computers to store and manipulate text in a consistent and standardized way, regardless of the language or writing system used. Unicode supports over 143,000 characters, including symbols, emojis, and characters from various languages.

**Example:**
Here is an example of how Unicode represents the letter "A" in different scripts:

- Latin script: U+0041 (ASCII value)
- Cyrillic script: U+0410
- Greek script: U+0391

Each script has its range of Unicode code points to represent its characters, ensuring that text can be correctly displayed and processed across different systems and platforms.
