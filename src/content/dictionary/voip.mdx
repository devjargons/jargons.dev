Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a technology that allows voice communication and multimedia sessions to be transmitted over the Internet or other IP-based networks. It converts analog voice signals into digital data packets, transmits them over the network, and then reassembles them into audio signals on the receiving end.

VoIP enables telephone calls and other voice communications to occur over the Internet rather than through traditional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) lines. This technology has revolutionized telecommunication by offering a more flexible, scalable, and cost-effective way to communicate.
