title: "Virtual Machine (VM)"
---
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It allows multiple operating systems (OS) to run simultaneously on a single physical machine. Each VM operates as if it were a separate physical computer, with its own CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces, but it is actually sharing these resources with the host machine.

VMs are commonly used in scenarios such as:

1. **Server Virtualization:** Running multiple virtual servers on a single physical server to maximize hardware utilization and facilitate efficient resource management.
   
2. **Development and Testing:** Providing isolated environments for software development, testing, and debugging without affecting the host system.

3. **Legacy Software Support:** Running older or incompatible software that requires specific OS environments, which may not be feasible or secure on modern hardware.
