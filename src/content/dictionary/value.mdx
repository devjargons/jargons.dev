A value is a piece of data that can be assigned to a variable or constant in a program. Values can be of various types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, and more.

Values represent the actual data that variables and constants store. They can be simple (like numbers and strings) or complex (like objects and arrays). Each value has a type that determines how it can be used and what operations can be performed on it.
