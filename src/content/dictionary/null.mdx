In programming, `null` is a special value that represents the absence of a value or a null reference. It is typically used to indicate that a variable or object does not currently point to any valid data or does not have a meaningful value.

- `null` is often used to initialize variables or objects when you want to indicate that they have not yet been assigned a value.
- In some programming languages, `null` is distinct from `undefined`, which typically represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.

**Example (JavaScript):**
```javascript
let value = null; // value is explicitly set to null

let obj = null; // obj is set to null to indicate that it does not currently reference an object

console.log(value); // Output: null
```
