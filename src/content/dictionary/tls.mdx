title: "Transport Layer Security (TLS)"
---
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol used to secure communication over a computer network. It ensures data privacy and integrity between communicating applications, such as web browsers and servers, email clients and servers, or other types of client-server communications.

TLS encrypts the data transmitted between two parties, preventing unauthorized interception and tampering. It also provides authentication mechanisms to verify the identities of the communicating parties. TLS is the successor to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and is widely used to secure sensitive data transmitted over the internet, such as financial transactions, personal information, and communications.

**Example:**
When you visit a website that uses HTTPS (HTTP over TLS), your web browser and the web server establish a secure TLS connection. This ensures that any data you enter on the website, such as login credentials or credit card information, is encrypted and secure from eavesdroppers.
