title: "First-Class Function"
---
In programming language design, a first-class function is a function that can be treated like any other variable or value. This means that a first-class function can be passed as an argument to other functions, returned as a value from other functions, and assigned to variables.

The concept of first-class functions is a fundamental feature of functional programming languages. It allows functions to be manipulated and used as data, enabling powerful programming techniques such as higher-order functions, closures, and function composition.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Assigning a function to a variable
const greet = function(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

// Passing a function as an argument to another function
function sayHello(greetingFunction) {
    console.log(greetingFunction("John"));
}

sayHello(greet);

// Returning a function from another function
function createGreeter() {
    return function(name) {
        return `Hola, ${name}!`;
    };
}

const spanishGreeter = createGreeter();
console.log(spanishGreeter("Maria"));
```
