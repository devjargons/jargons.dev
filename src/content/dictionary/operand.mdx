An operand is a term used in programming and computer science to refer to the data on which an operator acts. It is an input to an operation, and can be a constant, variable, or complex expression.

In an expression, operands are the values or entities that operators manipulate. For example, in the arithmetic expression `5 + 3`, `5` and `3` are operands, and `+` is the operator.

**Example:**
Hereâ€™s an example in JavaScript:

```javascript
let a = 10;  // Operand
let b = 20;  // Operand
let result = a + b;  // 'a' and 'b' are operands, '+' is the operator
console.log(result);  // Output: 30
```

Operands can also be more complex expressions:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = (x * 2) + 3;  // 'x * 2' and '3' are operands, '*' and '+' are operators
console.log(y);  // Output: 13
```
