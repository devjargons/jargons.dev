P2P, or Peer-to-Peer, is a decentralized communication model in which each party, known as a peer, has equivalent capabilities and responsibilities. In a P2P network, peers connect directly to each other to share resources, data, or services without requiring a central server.

In a Peer-to-Peer network, each participant (peer) can act both as a client and a server. This means that any peer can initiate or complete a transaction, and all peers share the network's load. P2P networks are commonly used for file sharing, cryptocurrency transactions, and distributed computing.
