An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. Exceptions are typically errors or unexpected conditions that a program must handle to avoid crashing or producing incorrect results.

Exceptions provide a way to signal and handle error conditions or other exceptional events in a controlled manner. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of execution is interrupted, and control is transferred to an exception handler, a block of code designed to respond to the specific error or condition.

**Key Concepts of Exceptions:**
1. **Throwing an Exception:** This is the act of signaling that an exceptional condition has occurred. In many programming languages, this is done using a `throw` or `raise` statement.
2. **Catching an Exception:** This involves intercepting the exception and providing a response. This is typically done using `try` and `catch` (or `except`) blocks.
3. **Exception Handling:** The process of responding to exceptions. This may involve logging the error, cleaning up resources, or attempting to recover from the error.
4. **Exception Hierarchy:** Many programming languages define a hierarchy of exception classes, allowing different types of exceptions to be caught and handled separately.
5. **Unchecked and Checked Exceptions:** In some languages (like Java), exceptions are categorized as checked (must be declared and handled) or unchecked (not required to be declared or handled).

**Example:**
Consider an example of exception handling in JavaScript:

```javascript
function divide(a, b) {
    if (b === 0) {
        throw new Error("Division by zero is not allowed");
    }
    return a / b;
}

try {
    let result = divide(10, 0);
    console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred: " + error.message);
}
```

**Explanation of the Example:**
- **Throwing an Exception:** The `divide` function checks if the denominator (`b`) is zero. If it is, the function throws an exception using `throw new Error("Division by zero is not allowed")`.
- **Catching an Exception:** The `try` block contains the code that might throw an exception. If an exception is thrown, control is transferred to the `catch` block, where the error is handled by logging an error message.
