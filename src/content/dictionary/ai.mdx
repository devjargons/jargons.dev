Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and even exhibiting creativity.

AI encompasses a range of technologies and approaches aimed at mimicking cognitive functions. There are various branches of AI, including:

- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The ability of machines to understand and generate human language.
- **Computer Vision:** The ability of machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual inputs from the world.
- **Robotics:** The branch of AI focused on designing and operating robots that can perform physical tasks autonomously.
- **Expert Systems:** AI systems that mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in specific domains.
