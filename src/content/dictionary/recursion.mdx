Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It is a powerful concept in programming that allows for elegant solutions to problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.

In recursion, a function solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller, simpler instances of the same problem. Each recursive call works on a smaller subset of the original problem until a base case is reached, which is a problem small enough to be solved without further recursion. The results of the base cases are then combined to produce the final result.

**Example (Factorial in Python):**
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

result = factorial(5)
print(result)  # Output: 120
```
In this example, the `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a number `n` by recursively calling itself with `n-1` until it reaches the base case of `n == 0`.
