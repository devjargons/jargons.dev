In programming, binding refers to the process of associating a value with a variable or a function with a name. Binding allows you to create a relationship between a name (identifier) and the entity it represents, such as a value, object, or function. Once bound, the name can be used to refer to the entity throughout the program.

Binding is a fundamental concept in programming languages and is used to create variables, functions, and other named entities. When a value is bound to a variable, the variable becomes a reference to that value. When a function is bound to a name, the name can be used to call the function and execute its code.

**Examples:**
- **Variable Binding:** `let x = 10;` binds the value `10` to the variable `x`.
- **Function Binding:** `function greet(name) { return "Hello, " + name; }` binds the function `greet` to the name `greet`, allowing you to call `greet('John')` to get the result `"Hello, John"`.

**Use Case:**
```javascript
let x = 10; // Binding the value 10 to the variable x
function add(a, b) { return a + b; } // Binding the function add to the name add
```

In this example, the value `10` is bound to the variable `x`, and the function `add` is bound to the name `add`. These bindings allow you to use `x` to refer to the value `10` and `add` to refer to the function `add` throughout your program.
