A port is a communication endpoint in a computer network that is used to identify a specific process or application running on a device. Ports allow multiple applications to share the same network connection on a single device.

In networking, ports are used to differentiate between different types of traffic (e.g., web traffic, email traffic, etc.) and direct incoming data packets to the appropriate application or service. Ports are identified by numbers ranging from 0 to 65535. The first 1024 ports (0-1023) are well-known ports reserved for specific services (e.g., HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443).

**Example:**
When you visit a website, your web browser sends a request to the web server on port 80 (or port 443 for HTTPS). The server processes the request and sends back the webpage data through the same port.
