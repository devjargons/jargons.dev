A glyph is a graphical representation of a character in a particular font or script. It is the visual embodiment of a character, such as a letter, number, or symbol, and is used to display text on a screen or in print.

In typography, a glyph is a specific instance of a character that is rendered in a particular style or design. For example, the letter "A" can be represented by different glyphs in different fonts, each with its own unique appearance and characteristics.
