An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. It is a design pattern also known as a self-executing anonymous function and has two main parts: the function definition and the invocation of that function immediately after its definition.

IIFEs are commonly used to create a new scope and avoid polluting the global namespace. This pattern is especially useful for encapsulating code, preventing variable collisions, and creating private variables.

**Syntax:**
The syntax for an IIFE involves wrapping the function in parentheses and then invoking it immediately with another set of parentheses.

```javascript
(function () {
    // Function body
})();
```

Alternatively, the syntax can also look like this:

```javascript
(function () {
    // Function body
}());
```

**Example of an IIFE:**
```javascript
(function () {
    var message = "Hello, World!";
    console.log(message);
})();
```
In this example, the function is defined and immediately invoked, logging "Hello, World!" to the console. The variable `message` is not accessible outside the IIFE, ensuring it does not interfere with other code.

**IIFE with Parameters:**
IIFEs can also accept parameters, allowing for greater flexibility and reuse.

```javascript
(function (name) {
    var greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
    console.log(greeting);
})('Alice');
```
This IIFE takes the parameter `name` and logs "Hello, Alice!" to the console.
