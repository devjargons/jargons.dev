In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances) that share similar properties and behaviors. A class defines the structure and behavior of objects, including their properties (attributes) and methods (functions).

Classes are a fundamental concept in OOP and are used to create objects that encapsulate data and functionality. Each object created from a class is known as an instance of that class and inherits its properties and methods. Classes provide a way to model real-world entities and define their behavior in a structured and reusable manner.

**Key Concepts of Classes:**
1. **Properties (Attributes):** Properties are the data members of a class that define the characteristics or state of an object. They represent the object's attributes.
2. **Methods (Functions):** Methods are the functions defined within a class that define the behavior or actions that an object can perform.
3. **Constructor:** A constructor is a special method in a class that is used to initialize new objects. It is called automatically when a new object is created.
4. **Inheritance:** Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It promotes code reusability and helps in creating a hierarchy of classes.
5. **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (properties) and methods that operate on the data (methods) into a single unit (class). It helps in data hiding and abstraction.
6. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

**Example:**
```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is speaking.`);
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the Animal class
const dog = new Animal('Buddy', 5);
dog.speak(); // Output: Buddy is speaking.
```

In this example, `Animal` is a class that defines the blueprint for creating animal objects. The `constructor` method is used to initialize the `name` and `age` properties of an animal object, and the `speak` method defines the behavior of an animal speaking.
