A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, storing, and retrieving data efficiently. Different data structures are designed to suit specific kinds of applications and optimize various operations, such as searching, sorting, and manipulating data.

Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. They are fundamental to designing efficient algorithms and are essential for both time and space complexity optimization.

**Common Types of Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables

**JavaScript Example:**
Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating a simple use of an array and an object as a hash table in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Array example
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(array[2]); // Outputs: 3

// Hash table example using an object
const hashTable = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25
};

console.log(hashTable["name"]); // Outputs: Alice
console.log(hashTable.age);     // Outputs: 25
```
