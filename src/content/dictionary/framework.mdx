A framework is a reusable software environment that provides a structure and set of tools for developing applications. It simplifies the process of creating complex applications by providing pre-built components, libraries, and guidelines that help developers follow best practices and focus on application-specific logic.

Frameworks typically include a set of libraries, code templates, and guidelines that abstract common tasks, such as database interaction, user interface development, and authentication. They often enforce a specific architecture or design pattern, such as MVC (Model-View-Controller), to promote code organization and maintainability.

Frameworks can be classified into two main categories:

1. **Frontend Frameworks:** Used for developing the user interface of web applications. Examples include Angular, React, and Vue.js, which provide components for building interactive user interfaces.

2. **Backend Frameworks:** Used for developing the server-side logic of web applications. Examples include Express.js for Node.js, Django for Python, and Rails for Ruby, which provide tools for routing, middleware, and database interaction.

**Example:**
Using a frontend framework like React, you can create a simple component that displays a list of items:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ItemList = ({ items }) => (
  <ul>
    {items.map(item => (
      <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);

export default ItemList;
```

In this example, React provides the `React` object for creating components and the `jsx` syntax for defining the component's structure. The `ItemList` component takes an array of items as a prop and renders them as a list.
