A deep copy is the process of creating a new copy of an object where all nested objects and arrays are recursively copied, resulting in a completely independent clone of the original object.

A deep copy means that any changes made to the new object will not affect the original object, and vice versa. This is in contrast to a shallow copy, which only copies the top-level properties, leading to shared references for nested objects or arrays.

**JavaScript Example:**

In JavaScript, creating a deep copy can be done using various methods, such as using libraries like Lodash or by utilizing JSON methods (though with limitations).

1. **Using JSON methods (limitations include inability to copy functions, undefined, and special objects like Date):**

```javascript
const originalObject = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  address: {
    city: "Wonderland",
    zip: "12345"
  }
};

const deepCopiedObject = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObject));

// Modifying the deep copy
deepCopiedObject.address.city = "New Wonderland";

console.log(originalObject.address.city); // Outputs: Wonderland
console.log(deepCopiedObject.address.city); // Outputs: New Wonderland
```
