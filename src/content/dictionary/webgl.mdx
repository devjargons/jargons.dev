WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. It is based on OpenGL ES (Embedded Systems), a subset of the OpenGL graphics rendering API commonly used in embedded systems.

1. **Hardware Acceleration**: WebGL leverages the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) of a device to render graphics, allowing for high-performance 2D and 3D graphics rendering in web applications.

2. **Cross-Platform**: WebGL is supported by most modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, making it a cross-platform solution for interactive graphics on the web.
