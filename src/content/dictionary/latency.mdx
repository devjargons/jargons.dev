Latency, in the context of computing and networking, refers to the delay between the initiation of a request for data and the receipt of the data. It is typically measured in milliseconds (ms) and is a key factor in determining the responsiveness of a system or network.

Latency can be caused by various factors, including the distance between the client and server, the speed of the network connection, and the processing time required by the server to respond to a request. Lower latency is desirable, especially in real-time applications such as online gaming, video conferencing, and financial trading, where delays can significantly impact user experience.
