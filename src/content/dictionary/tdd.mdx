title: 'TDD (Test-Driven Development)'
---
A software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Example: Writing a failing test for a new feature, then writing the code to make the test pass.
