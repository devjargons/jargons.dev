title: "GPL (General-Purpose Language)"
---
A General-Purpose Language (GPL) is a programming language designed to be used for writing software in a wide variety of application domains. GPLs are versatile and can be employed to develop a range of applications, from system software to web applications and everything in between.

Unlike Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), which are tailored to a specific application domain, GPLs are broad in scope and offer a comprehensive set of features to handle different types of programming tasks. Common examples of GPLs include JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, and Ruby.

**Examples:**
1. **JavaScript:** Widely used for web development to create interactive web pages and applications.
2. **Python:** Known for its simplicity and readability, used in web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and more.
3. **Java:** Used in web applications, enterprise software, mobile applications (especially Android), and large systems development.
4. **C++:** Used in system/software, game development, and applications requiring high-performance graphics.

**JavaScript Example:**
Here is a simple example of a general-purpose programming task in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Function to calculate the factorial of a number
function factorial(n) {
  if (n < 0) return -1; // Factorial of negative numbers is undefined
  if (n === 0) return 1; // Factorial of 0 is 1
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    result *= i;
  }
  return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```
