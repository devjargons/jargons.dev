An identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or other entity in a programming language. Identifiers are used to label and reference these entities in the code, allowing programmers to interact with and manipulate them.

Identifiers must follow specific naming rules and conventions defined by the programming language. These rules typically include:

1. **Starting Character:** Identifiers usually must begin with a letter (a-z or A-Z) or an underscore (_). Some languages also allow starting with a dollar sign ($).
2. **Subsequent Characters:** After the initial character, identifiers can include letters, digits (0-9), underscores, and sometimes other special characters, depending on the language.
3. **Case Sensitivity:** Many programming languages treat identifiers as case-sensitive, meaning `foo` and `Foo` would be considered different identifiers.

**Example in JavaScript:**
Here is an example demonstrating the use of identifiers in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Variable identifier
let userName = 'Alice';

// Function identifier
function greetUser() {
    console.log('Hello, ' + userName);
}

// Class identifier
class User {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Method identifier
    sayHello() {
        console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
    }
}

greetUser(); // Output: Hello, Alice

const user = new User('Bob');
user.sayHello(); // Output: Hello, Bob
```

In this example, `userName`, `greetUser`, `User`, and `sayHello` are all identifiers used to name and reference variables, functions, and classes.
