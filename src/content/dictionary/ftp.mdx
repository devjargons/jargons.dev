FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network. It is a client-server protocol, which means that the client initiates a connection to the server to request files and the server responds by sending the requested files.

FTP is commonly used for transferring files over the internet, such as uploading files to a website or downloading files from a server. It provides a simple and efficient way to transfer files, although it does not provide encryption for data transmission, making it less secure than other protocols like SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP Secure).
