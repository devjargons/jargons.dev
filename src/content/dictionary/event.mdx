An event is an action or occurrence recognized by software that may be handled by the software. Events can be generated by user actions, such as clicking a mouse button or pressing a key, as well as by other programmatic means, such as a timer expiration or a message from another program.

Events are fundamental to programming, especially in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and web development, where they are used to create interactive and dynamic experiences. An event-driven programming model is one in which the flow of the program is determined by events, such as user inputs or sensor outputs.

**Key Concepts of Events:**
1. **Event Source:** The object or element that generates an event. For example, a button in a web form.
2. **Event Listener (or Handler):** A function or method that is called in response to a specific event. It "listens" for the event to occur and then executes some code.
3. **Event Object:** An object that contains information about the event, such as the type of event and properties related to the event. This object is often passed as an argument to the event handler.
4. **Event Bubbling and Capturing:** In web development, events propagate through the DOM in two phases: capturing (from the root to the target) and bubbling (from the target back to the root). Handlers can intercept events at different stages of this propagation.

**Example:**
Consider an example of handling a button click event in JavaScript:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Event Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="myButton">Click Me!</button>

    <script>
        // Event listener for button click
        document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
            alert('Button was clicked!');
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation of the Example:**
- **Event Source:** The button element with the ID `myButton`.
- **Event Listener:** The function passed to `addEventListener` that displays an alert when the button is clicked.
- **Event Object:** The `event` parameter in the function provides details about the click event, though it is not used in this simple example.
