RSS (Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed format used to publish frequently updated content, such as blog posts, news headlines, audio, and video. It allows users to subscribe to a website's feed and receive updates in a standardized format.

RSS feeds contain structured XML data that includes information about the content, such as the title, author, publication date, and a summary. Users can subscribe to RSS feeds using feed reader software, which periodically checks for updates and displays new content from subscribed feeds.

RSS feeds are commonly used by websites and blogs to syndicate their content, allowing users to stay updated without visiting the website directly. RSS feeds can also be used to aggregate content from multiple sources into a single feed, providing a convenient way to consume information from various websites.
