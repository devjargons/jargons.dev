title: "Pseudocode"
---
Pseudocode is a way of representing algorithms in a way that is more similar to human language than programming language syntax. It uses natural language constructs to outline the steps of an algorithm, making it easier to understand and conceptualize without being tied to a specific programming language.

Pseudocode is often used during the planning and design phase of software development to outline the logic of a program before actual coding begins. It can be thought of as a high-level description of an algorithm that abstracts away the details of programming syntax.

**Example:**
```
Algorithm to find the maximum of two numbers:

1. Start
2. Input num1, num2
3. If num1 > num2
4.     Output num1
5. Else
6.     Output num2
7. End
```
