JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development. It is an essential technology for creating interactive and dynamic websites.

JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for both client-side and server-side development. It is primarily known for its use in web browsers to create interactive features and dynamic content on web pages. JavaScript can also be used with frameworks and libraries to build complex web applications.

**Key Features:**
- **Client-Side Scripting:** JavaScript is primarily used in web browsers to create interactive user interfaces and dynamic web content.
- **Server-Side Development:** JavaScript can also be used on the server side with platforms like Node.js to build scalable and efficient server applications.
- **Object-Oriented:** JavaScript supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance.
- **Functional Programming:** JavaScript supports functional programming paradigms, allowing functions to be used as first-class citizens.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** JavaScript uses callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax for asynchronous programming, making it well-suited for handling asynchronous operations like network requests.

**Example:**
Here is a simple example of JavaScript code that adds two numbers:

```javascript
// Define a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Call the function
var result = add(10, 20);
console.log(result); // Output: 30
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Web Development:** JavaScript is essential for creating interactive web pages and web applications.
- **Mobile App Development:** JavaScript frameworks like React Native and Ionic allow developers to build cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript.
- **Server-Side Development:** JavaScript can be used with Node.js to build server-side applications and APIs.
- **Game Development:** JavaScript can be used with libraries like Phaser and Three.js to create browser-based games.
