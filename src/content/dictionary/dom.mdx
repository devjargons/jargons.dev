The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing programs to manipulate the content, structure, and style of a document dynamically.

In web development, the DOM is used to interact with HTML, XML, or XHTML documents. It provides a structured representation of the document's elements, such as tags, attributes, and text content, as objects that can be accessed and manipulated using programming languages like JavaScript.

**Example:**
Consider the following HTML document:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>DOM Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
In this document, the `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>` elements are represented as nodes in the DOM tree.
