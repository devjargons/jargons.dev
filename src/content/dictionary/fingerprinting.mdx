Fingerprinting, in the context of web browsers, is a technique used to track and identify individual users based on the unique characteristics of their browser and device. These characteristics can include information such as browser version, operating system, screen resolution, installed plugins, and other settings that can be detected by websites.

Fingerprinting is often used by websites and advertisers to create a unique identifier for a user without relying on cookies or other traditional tracking methods. This allows them to track users across different websites and sessions, even if the user has disabled cookies or uses private browsing modes.
