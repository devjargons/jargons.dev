SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based markup language used to create two-dimensional vector graphics. SVG graphics are scalable, meaning they can be resized without loss of quality, and are supported by most modern web browsers.

SVG is used to define graphics in XML format, which means that every element and attribute within the SVG file can be manipulated through CSS and JavaScript. SVG is particularly useful for creating images that need to be displayed at various sizes and resolutions, such as icons, logos, and complex illustrations.

SVG files are plain text files, which makes them easy to compress, manipulate, and animate. They can include various graphic elements like paths, shapes, text, and filters. SVG supports interactivity and animation, making it a versatile choice for web graphics.

**Example (SVG Graphic):**

Here is an example of a simple SVG graphic:

```xml
<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
</svg>
```

This SVG code creates a red circle with a black border:

- `width` and `height` specify the dimensions of the SVG canvas.
- `circle` is an SVG element to draw a circle.
- `cx` and `cy` define the center of the circle.
- `r` specifies the radius of the circle.
- `stroke`, `stroke-width`, and `fill` define the styling of the circle.
