title: "Nullish Value"
---
A nullish value is a value that is either `null` or `undefined` in JavaScript. Nullish values are distinct from other falsy values (such as `0`, `''`, and `false`) because they specifically represent the absence of a meaningful value rather than a value that evaluates to false in a boolean context.

- The nullish coalescing operator (`??`) is commonly used in JavaScript to provide a default value for a variable that may be nullish.
- Nullish values are often used to distinguish between a variable that has not been assigned a value and a variable that has been explicitly set to a nullish value.

**Example:**
```javascript
let value1 = null;
let value2 = undefined;
let value3 = 0;
let value4 = '';

console.log(value1 ?? 'default'); // Output: 'default'
console.log(value2 ?? 'default'); // Output: 'default'
console.log(value3 ?? 'default'); // Output: 0 (0 is not nullish)
console.log(value4 ?? 'default'); // Output: '' (empty string is not nullish)
```
