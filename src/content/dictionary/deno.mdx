Deno is a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, designed as a secure and productive alternative to Node.js. It was created by Ryan Dahl, the original developer of Node.js, to address several design shortcomings of Node.js.

Deno aims to offer a more secure and productive development environment by providing built-in TypeScript support, a more secure execution environment, and a more straightforward module system. It also strives to avoid the legacy issues found in Node.js by taking advantage of new JavaScript features and modern software development practices.
