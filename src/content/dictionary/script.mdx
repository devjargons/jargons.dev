A script is a set of instructions written in a scripting language that is executed by a scripting engine or interpreter. Scripts are often used to automate tasks, manipulate data, or control the behavior of applications and websites.

Scripts are commonly used in various contexts, including web development, system administration, and software automation. They are typically written in languages such as JavaScript, Python, Perl, or Bash. Scripts are executed line-by-line by an interpreter, making them different from compiled programs, which are converted into machine code before execution.
