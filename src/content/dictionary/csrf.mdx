Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of security attack in which a malicious website, email, or program causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated.

CSRF exploits the trust that a website has in a user's browser. For example, if a user is logged into a bank website and then visits a malicious site, the malicious site could trigger a request to the bank site without the user's knowledge, potentially causing unauthorized actions like transferring funds.

**Example (JavaScript):**

Here's an example illustrating a CSRF attack and its mitigation:

**Vulnerable Scenario:**
Suppose a banking site allows money transfers through a simple form submission without additional protection:

```html
<form action="https://bank.com/transfer" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
  <input type="hidden" name="to_account" value="attacker_account">
  <input type="submit" value="Transfer">
</form>
```

If the user is logged into their bank account, a malicious site could include a similar form and use JavaScript to automatically submit it, causing an unauthorized transfer:

```html
<!-- Malicious website -->
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
  <form action="https://bank.com/transfer" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
    <input type="hidden" name="to_account" value="attacker_account">
  </form>
</body>
```

**Mitigation:**
To protect against CSRF, websites commonly use anti-CSRF tokens, which are unique tokens included in each request and validated by the server.

**Secure Implementation:**

On the server side, generate a CSRF token and include it in forms:

```html
<!-- Secure banking site -->
<form action="https://bank.com/transfer" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="unique_token_from_server">
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
  <input type="hidden" name="to_account" value="recipient_account">
  <input type="submit" value="Transfer">
</form>
```

On the server side, validate the token:

```javascript
// Server-side CSRF token validation (example in JavaScript/Node.js)
app.post('/transfer', (req, res) => {
  const token = req.body.csrf_token;
  if (token !== req.session.csrf_token) {
    return res.status(403).send('CSRF token validation failed');
  }
  // Process the transfer
});
```

In this example, `req.session.csrf_token` is a token stored in the user's session. Each form submission must include a matching token to be processed successfully.
