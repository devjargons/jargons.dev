A protocol is a set of rules and conventions that govern how data is formatted and transmitted over a network. Protocols define the syntax, semantics, and synchronization of communication, allowing different systems to communicate with each other.

In networking, protocols are essential for enabling devices to communicate effectively. They specify how data should be formatted for transmission, how devices should establish and terminate connections, and how errors should be handled. Protocols can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both.

**Example:**
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Used for transmitting web pages and other resources over the internet. HTTP defines how web browsers request web pages from servers and how servers respond to these requests.
- **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):** A suite of protocols that defines how data should be formatted, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received across networks. TCP/IP is the foundation of the internet and most local networks.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used for sending email messages between servers. SMTP defines how email messages should be formatted and transmitted over the internet.
