A loop is a programming construct that repeats a block of code until a certain condition is met. It allows for the efficient repetition of tasks, such as iterating over a collection of items or executing a set of statements multiple times.

Loops are commonly used for iterating over arrays, processing input, and implementing repetitive tasks.

**Example:**
Here's an example of a `for` loop in JavaScript that iterates over an array and logs each element to the console:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    console.log(numbers[i]);
}
```

In this example:
- The `for` loop is used to iterate over the `numbers` array.
- The loop starts with `i` set to 0, and iterates as long as `i` is less than the length of the `numbers` array.
- The `console.log` statement inside the loop logs each element of the `numbers` array to the console.
