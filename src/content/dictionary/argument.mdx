In programming, an argument is a value that is passed to a function or method when it is called. Arguments are used to provide the function with the data it needs to perform its task. Functions can accept zero or more arguments, depending on their definition.

When a function is called, the values of its arguments are copied into the function's parameters. The function can then use these values to perform calculations, make decisions, or return a result. Arguments can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, arrays, objects, or even other functions.

**Examples:**
```javascript
// Function that takes two arguments and returns their sum
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Calling the function with arguments 5 and 10
let result = addNumbers(5, 10);
console.log(result); // Output: 15
```

In this example, the `addNumbers` function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. When the function is called with the arguments `5` and `10`, it returns `15`, which is then assigned to the `result` variable.
