Bandwidth, in the context of computer networking, refers to the maximum rate at which data can be transferred between devices or over a network. It is typically measured in bits per second (bps) and represents the capacity of the network connection to transmit data.

Bandwidth is a crucial factor in determining the speed and performance of a network. A higher bandwidth means that more data can be transferred in a given amount of time, resulting in faster download and upload speeds. Bandwidth is often shared among multiple devices on a network, so the actual speed experienced by a user may vary depending on network congestion and other factors.

**Examples:**
- **Internet Connection:** An internet service provider (ISP) may offer different bandwidth options, such as 100 Mbps (megabits per second) or 1 Gbps (gigabit per second), to customers.
- **Network Interface:** A network interface card (NIC) in a computer may support different bandwidths, such as 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps) for Gigabit Ethernet.

**Use Case:**
A user with a 100 Mbps internet connection can download a 1 GB file in approximately 80 seconds, assuming the full bandwidth is available and no other factors are limiting the speed.
