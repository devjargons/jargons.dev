Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to interpret and process visual information from the world, simulating the human vision system.

Computer Vision involves the acquisition, processing, and analysis of images and videos to enable computers to understand and make decisions based on visual data. This field leverages various algorithms, models, and techniques to perform tasks such as:

- **Image Recognition:** Identifying objects, places, people, or actions in images.
- **Object Detection:** Locating and identifying multiple objects within an image.
- **Image Segmentation:** Dividing an image into segments to simplify analysis.
- **Facial Recognition:** Identifying or verifying individuals based on facial features.
- **Image Generation:** Creating new images or enhancing existing ones.
- **Video Analysis:** Analyzing video sequences to detect activities, movements, or changes over time.

Computer Vision applications range from everyday technologies like facial recognition on smartphones to advanced systems in medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance.
