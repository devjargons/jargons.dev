A slug is a simplified, URL-friendly version of a string that is typically used to identify a resource in a web application. Slugs are commonly used in URLs to make them more readable and SEO-friendly.

In the context of web development, a slug is often generated from the title of an article, blog post, or other content, by converting it into a format that can be used in a URL. This typically involves removing special characters, converting spaces to hyphens, and converting all letters to lowercase.

**Example (Generating a Slug):**
For example, given the title "10 Tips for Better SEO", a slug might be generated as **"10-tips-for-better-seo"**. This slug can then be used in a URL, such as **"https://example.com/blog/10-tips-for-better-seo"**.
