A GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a visual interface that allows users to interact with a computer or software application through graphical elements such as icons, buttons, and menus, rather than text-based commands.

GUIs provide an intuitive and user-friendly way for users to interact with digital devices. They enable users to perform tasks by manipulating visual elements on the screen, which can include windows, icons, buttons, and other graphical controls. This interaction model contrasts with command-line interfaces (CLIs), where users must type textual commands to perform tasks. GUIs are prevalent in modern operating systems, software applications, and web applications, making technology more accessible to a broader audience.
