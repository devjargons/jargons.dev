RTL (Right-to-Left) is a text directionality attribute used in writing and displaying languages that are written from right to left. This includes languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian.

In RTL writing systems, text is read from right to left, with successive characters being added to the left of the previous ones. This is in contrast to left-to-right (LTR) writing systems, such as English, where text is read from left to right.

When displaying RTL text on a screen, software applications must be designed to handle the RTL directionality correctly. This includes rendering the text in the correct order, aligning text and elements appropriately, and handling interactions such as text selection and cursor movement.
