A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server. SPAs use AJAX and HTML5 to create fluid and responsive web apps that provide a more seamless user experience similar to desktop applications.

In a traditional web application, each interaction with the application typically involves loading a new web page from the server. This can result in slower user experience as the entire page needs to be reloaded, including its resources (such as CSS, JavaScript, and images).

SPAs, on the other hand, load the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript when the user first accesses the application. Subsequent interactions with the application are handled by JavaScript, which dynamically updates the content of the page without requiring a full page reload. This allows for faster and more responsive user interfaces.

**Example (SPA Frameworks):**
Popular frameworks for building SPAs include AngularJS, React, and Vue.js. These frameworks provide tools and libraries for creating interactive and dynamic web applications that run entirely in the browser.
