UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are two closely related but distinct aspects of designing and developing digital products, such as websites and mobile applications.

- **UI (User Interface):** UI refers to the visual elements of a digital product with which a user interacts. It includes components such as buttons, forms, icons, and layout design. The primary goal of UI design is to create an intuitive, visually appealing interface that is easy for users to navigate and understand.
  
- **UX (User Experience):** UX encompasses all aspects of a user's interaction with a digital product, including UI design, usability, accessibility, and overall satisfaction. UX design focuses on understanding users' needs and behaviors to create a seamless and enjoyable experience.

**Example:**
In the design of a mobile banking application:
- **UI Design:** Includes the layout of the app's screens, the design of buttons and icons, and the use of colors and typography to create a visually appealing interface.
  
- **UX Design:** Focuses on ensuring that the app is easy to navigate, that users can quickly access their account information and perform transactions, and that the overall experience is secure and trustworthy.
