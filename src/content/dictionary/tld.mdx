A Top-Level Domain (TLD) is the last segment of a domain name, following the final dot ("."). TLDs are part of the Domain Name System (DNS) hierarchy and are used to categorize domain names based on their purpose or geographical location.

TLDs are divided into different categories, each serving a specific purpose or geographical region. The most common types of TLDs include generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as .com, .org, and .net, which are used for general purposes, and country code top-level domains (ccTLDs), such as .us, .uk, and .de, which are used to indicate a specific country or territory.

**Example:**
In the domain name "example.com," the TLD is ".com." In "example.co.uk," the TLD is ".co.uk." The choice of TLD often reflects the purpose or nature of the website, such as ".org" for organizations, ".gov" for government agencies, and ".edu" for educational institutions.
