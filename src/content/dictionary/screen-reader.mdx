A screen reader is a software application that interprets and translates digital text into synthesized speech or braille output. It is primarily used by people who are blind or visually impaired to access digital content, including websites, documents, and applications.

Screen readers work by accessing the content displayed on a computer screen and converting it into a format that can be understood by users who are blind or visually impaired. They use various techniques to navigate and interact with digital content, such as reading text aloud, describing images, and providing keyboard shortcuts for navigation.

Screen readers are essential tools for accessibility, enabling people with visual impairments to access and interact with digital content independently. They can also benefit individuals with other disabilities, such as those with cognitive impairments or learning disabilities, by providing alternative ways to access information.
