Concatenate refers to the operation of joining two or more strings or data sequences end-to-end to form a single, longer string or sequence.

In programming, concatenation is a common operation used to combine strings, arrays, or other sequences of data. This operation is essential for tasks that involve text manipulation, data formatting, or the assembly of complex data structures from simpler components.

**JavaScript Example:**

```javascript
// Concatenating strings
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

console.log(fullName); // Output: John Doe

// Concatenating arrays
let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
let array2 = [4, 5, 6];
let combinedArray = array1.concat(array2);

console.log(combinedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

// Using template literals for string concatenation
let greeting = `Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`;

console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, John Doe!
```

In the examples above:
- **String Concatenation:** The `+` operator is used to concatenate two strings, `firstName` and `lastName`, with a space in between.
- **Array Concatenation:** The `concat` method is used to concatenate two arrays, `array1` and `array2`, resulting in a single array.
- **Template Literals:** Template literals, enclosed by backticks (`` ` ``), allow for embedding expressions within string literals, providing a more readable and flexible way to concatenate strings.
