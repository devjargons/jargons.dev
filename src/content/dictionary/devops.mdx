DevOps is a set of practices and cultural philosophies that aim to improve collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. This approach seeks to automate and integrate the processes of software development, testing, deployment, and infrastructure management to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery.

DevOps focuses on breaking down the silos between development and operations teams, promoting a culture of continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and continuous feedback. It involves using tools and practices that automate the software development lifecycle (SDLC), enhance code quality, and reduce time to market. Key components of DevOps include:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI):** The practice of frequently merging code changes into a shared repository, where automated builds and tests are run.
2. **Continuous Delivery (CD):** The practice of automatically deploying code changes to a staging or production environment after passing the CI pipeline.
3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
4. **Monitoring and Logging:** Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure to detect and respond to issues in real-time.

**Example:**

Below is an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using a popular DevOps tool, Jenkins, to automate the build, test, and deployment process:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the application...'
                sh 'npm run deploy'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            echo 'Cleaning up...'
            cleanWs()
        }
        success {
            echo 'Deployment successful!'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Deployment failed!'
        }
    }
}
```

In this Jenkins pipeline:
- **Build Stage:** Installs the necessary dependencies for the application.
- **Test Stage:** Runs the test suite to ensure the application behaves as expected.
- **Deploy Stage:** Deploys the application if the tests pass.
- **Post Actions:** Always cleans up the workspace, and provides messages based on the outcome of the pipeline.
