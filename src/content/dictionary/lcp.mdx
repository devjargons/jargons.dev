Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is a user-centric performance metric that measures the perceived loading speed of a web page. It specifically focuses on the render time of the largest content element visible in the viewport, such as an image, video, or block of text.

LCP is part of Google's Core Web Vitals, a set of metrics designed to help website owners understand and improve user experience. A fast LCP indicates that the main content of the page is quickly loaded and visible to the user, contributing to a positive user experience.

**Example:**
If a webpage's main content is an image, the LCP would be the time it takes for that image to fully render in the viewport after the user navigates to the page.
