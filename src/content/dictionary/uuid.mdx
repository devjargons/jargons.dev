A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit value used to uniquely identify information in computer systems. It is designed to be globally unique, ensuring that no two UUIDs are the same across space and time.

UUIDs are used in various contexts where unique identification is necessary, such as database keys, component identifiers in distributed systems, and more. A UUID is represented as a 32-character hexadecimal string, typically displayed in five groups separated by hyphens, for example: `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`.
