PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP code is embedded within HTML documents or standalone PHP files, and is executed on the server to generate dynamic web pages.

PHP is widely used for web development due to its simplicity, ease of use, and integration with web servers. It can interact with databases, manage session tracking, and handle form data, making it suitable for building dynamic websites and web applications.

**Example:**
```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$name = "John Doe";
echo "Hello, $name!";
?>

</body>
</html>
```
