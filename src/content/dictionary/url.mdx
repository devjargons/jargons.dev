A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference or address used to access resources on the internet. It specifies the location of a resource as well as the protocol used to retrieve it.

A URL consists of several components, including the protocol, domain name, port (optional), path, query string (optional), and fragment (optional). Each part provides specific information about how to access the resource.

**Example:**
Here is an example of a URL and its components, followed by how to work with URLs in JavaScript:

```url
https://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource?query=example#fragment
```

- **Protocol:** `https` - The protocol used to access the resource (in this case, HTTPS).
- **Domain Name:** `www.example.com` - The domain name of the server where the resource is hosted.
- **Port:** `8080` - The port number on the server (optional and often omitted if using default ports for HTTP/HTTPS).
- **Path:** `/path/to/resource` - The path to the resource on the server.
- **Query String:** `?query=example` - Optional parameters sent to the server.
- **Fragment:** `#fragment` - A fragment identifier for a specific section of the resource (optional).
