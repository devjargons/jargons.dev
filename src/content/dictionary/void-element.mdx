A void element is an HTML element that does not have any content or closing tag.

Void elements, also known as self-closing tags or empty elements, are HTML elements that do not contain any content between an opening and a closing tag. They are defined by the HTML specification and are used to insert elements that do not require any text or child elements. Examples of void elements include `<br>`, `<img>`, `<input>`, `<meta>`, and `<link>`.

These elements are self-contained and are typically used for their attributes rather than for content. In HTML, void elements are written with just an opening tag. 

**Example:**

Here is an example of some common void elements in HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Void Elements Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Example Image">
  <br>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Enter text here">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- `<img>` is used to display an image.
- `<br>` is used to insert a line break.
- `<input>` is used to create a text input field.
- `<link>` is used to link an external stylesheet.
