title: "RGB (Red, Green, Blue)"
---
RGB is a color model used in digital design and imaging, where colors are represented as combinations of red, green, and blue light. It is an additive color model, meaning that colors are created by mixing different intensities of red, green, and blue light.

In the RGB color model, each color component (red, green, blue) is represented by an 8-bit value, ranging from 0 to 255, or a 16-bit value, ranging from 0 to 65535. By varying the intensity of each color component, a wide range of colors can be created.

In digital displays, such as computer monitors and TVs, each pixel is composed of three sub-pixels, one for each color (red, green, blue). By combining the intensities of the three sub-pixels, the display can produce millions of different colors.

**Example (RGB Color):**
In RGB notation, colors are represented as a combination of red, green, and blue components. For example, the color white is represented as RGB(255, 255, 255), which indicates full intensity for all three colors, while black is represented as RGB(0, 0, 0), indicating no intensity for any color.
