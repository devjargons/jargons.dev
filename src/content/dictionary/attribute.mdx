In web development, an attribute is a characteristic or property that is used to describe an HTML element and define its behavior or appearance. Attributes are added to HTML elements as key-value pairs, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value. Attributes can be used to specify things like the element's ID, class, style, or other metadata.

Attributes provide additional information about an HTML element that can be used by browsers, scripts, or stylesheets to modify or enhance the element's behavior or appearance. Some attributes are standard and have predefined meanings, while others are custom and can be used for specific purposes in a web page or application.

**Examples:**
- **id:** Specifies a unique identifier for an element, which can be used to target the element with CSS or JavaScript.
- **class:** Specifies one or more class names for an element, which can be used to apply styles or group elements together.
- **href:** Specifies the URL of a linked resource, such as a webpage or file, for anchor (`<a>`) elements.
- **src:** Specifies the URL of an image or other external resource to be displayed by an element, such as an `<img>` or `<script>` tag.

**Use Case:**
```html
<!-- Example: Using the src attribute to specify an image -->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful image">
```

In this example, the `src` attribute is used to specify the URL of an image (`image.jpg`) to be displayed by the `<img>` element. The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is important for accessibility and SEO purposes.
