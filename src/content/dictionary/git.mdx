**Git** is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for managing the Linux kernel development. Git is widely used in both open-source and commercial software development projects due to its efficiency and powerful features.

### Basic Git Workflow:

1. **Clone**: Clone a repository from a remote server to create a local copy on your machine.
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Add**: Add changes to the staging area to prepare them for commit.
   ```
   git add <file>
   ```

3. **Commit**: Commit changes to the repository with a descriptive message.
   ```
   git commit -m "Commit message"
   ```

4. **Push**: Push committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository.
   ```
   git push
   ```

5. **Pull**: Pull changes from a remote repository to update your local repository.
   ```
   git pull
   ```

6. **Branch**: Create, switch, and merge branches to work on different features or fixes.
   ```
   git branch <branch-name>
   git checkout <branch-name>
   git merge <branch-name>
   ```

Git provides a powerful set of tools for version control and collaboration in software development, enabling developers to work efficiently and effectively on projects of any size.
