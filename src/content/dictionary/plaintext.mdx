Plaintext refers to unencrypted data or text that is easily readable by humans. It is the original form of data before it has been encrypted or encoded into a format that is not easily readable.

Plaintext can refer to any type of data, such as text, images, or other files, that has not been encrypted. When data is in plaintext, it is vulnerable to interception or unauthorized access, as anyone who can access the data can read and understand its contents.

**Example:**
A plaintext message:
```
Hello, this is a plaintext message.
```
