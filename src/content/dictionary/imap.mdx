IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a standard email protocol that allows users to access and manage their email messages on a mail server. Unlike the POP3 protocol, which downloads messages to a local device, IMAP keeps emails on the server, allowing users to view and organize their messages from multiple devices.

IMAP provides a way for users to interact with their emails stored on a server, making it ideal for users who need to access their email from different locations and devices. When a user reads, deletes, or organizes an email using IMAP, these actions are synchronized with the server, ensuring that the state of the inbox is consistent across all devices.
