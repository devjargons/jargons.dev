WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an open-source technology created by Google that enables browser-to-browser real-time communication and data exchange, primarily focused on audio and video traffic. Without WebRTC, devices cannot connect with each other unless there is an intermediate server. Itâ€™s a powerful tool for building applications like video conferencing, live streaming, and online gaming.
